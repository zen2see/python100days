The open() function takes two parameters; filename, and mode.
There are four different methods (modes) for opening a file:
"r" - Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist
"a" - Append - Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist
"w" - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist
"x" - Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists
In addition you can specify if the file should be handled as binary or text mode
"t" - Text - Default value. Text mode
"b" - Binary - Binary mode (e.g. images)
** Delete a File
import os
os.remove("demofile.txt")
** Check if File exist:
import os
if os.path.exists("demofile.txt"):
  os.remove("demofile.txt")
else:
  print("The file does not exist")
** Delete Folder
import os
os.rmdir("myfolder")

Absolute - relative to your root directory
Relative - relative to your current directory

    If you have a really long format string that you donâ€™t want to split up, it would be nice if you 
    could reference the variables to be formatted by name instead of by position. This can be done by 
    simply passing the dict and using square brackets '[]' to access the keys.
