# NOTES
# home() = center of screen
# turtles state position() | pos()
# pos() = x-y coordinates
# abs(pos()) < 1 is a good way to know when the turtle is back at its home position.
# clearscreen()
# fillcolor('green')
# abs(pos()) < 1 is a good way to know when the turtle is back at its home position.
# forward(100) fd() move forward # left(120) turns left 120 degrees
# up(), down() determines whether the line will be drawin
# begin_fill() filing can be turned off
# setpos(60, 30) Move turtle to an abs pos. If the pen is down, draw line. no change of orientation.
# teleport(60, 30) Move turtle to an absolute position. Unlike goto(x, y), a line will not be drawn
# setx(x), sety(y), setheading(to_angle) seth 0-east 90-north 180-west 270-south
# circle(radius, extent=None, steps=None) turtle.circle(120, 180)  # draw a semicircle
# turtle.stamp()
# Stamp a copy of the turtle shape onto the canvas at the current turtle position. 
# Return a stamp_id for that stamp, which can be used to delete it by calling clearstamp(stamp_id).
